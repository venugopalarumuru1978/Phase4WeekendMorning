Today's Agenda:- 
----------------
1. TypeScript
2. Introduction to Angular
--------------------------
What is a TypeScript?

It is a programming language which is developed by using javascript. 

The purpose of the typescript,  Angular applications developed with the help of TypeScript. 


Features :-

1.   Data Types
2.   OOPS Concepts
3.   Misc Concepts
	Arrow Functions
	String Interpolation
	Multiline String hanndlings
	Modules(import and exports files)

TypeScript is a combination of JavaScript and additional features which above specified. 

TypeScript programs are not supports directly in html programming. So that here we have to translate typescript program into javascript, then we can use it in web page. 

TypeScript    ==>   Compiler  => JavaScript  ==> Run Program ==> Output. 

Data Types :- 
-------------
1. number :-  it is meant for both integers  and decimal values. 
2. string :-  it is meant for string values
3. boolean :-  it is meant for boolean values(true/false)
4. any :-   it is meant for any type value.

			var  <variablename> : <data type> = <value>;

What is an NPM?
	The Full form is : "Node Package Manager" Installer.
	It is a world largest software library for front end web programming languages.
	It exist nearly 8 Lakhs packages within it. 
	These all packages uses in different front end languages. 
		TypeScript
		Angular
		React JS
		Node JS
		Express JS
		Vue JS
	these all languages are needed "NPM", so that first we have to install "NPM" in our systems. 
	NPM is a Open Source, i.e. we can use freely.

	NPM will be installed with "Node JS" Software. by visiting http://nodejs.org, we can download 	and install it.

	Command Line Client(CLI) :-  with the help of CLI we can download and install softwares 	related to scripts(typescript/angular/react/...) as well as to run and execute these 		applications CLI provides some commands. 
	CLI comes with NPM.

How to download and install TypeScript:- 

	1. Goto the command prompt
	2. use following command 
		npm  install typescript -g

Steps to write TypeScript Program:- 
-----------------------------------
1.  Open Any Editor (VSCode)
2.  Code the program then save with .ts extension
3.  goto command prompt then compile the program 
		tsc filename.ts
4.  Once it is compiled successfully, it generates js file, now run the program as follows
		node filename.js
----------------------------------
OOPS Concepts:- 


Class Creation:- 


class <classname>
{
	variables declarations

	methodname([arg]) :  <return type>
	{
		body of the method
	}
	.............
}

Note :-  to access any variable inside the class, "this" keyword has to be used. 
		this.variable

Object Creation :- 
		var <object> = new ClassName([arg]);
		once object is created, we can access class member with object
			object.method()/variable
Here we got access specifiers also :-  private, public, protected
by default public is the access specifier for the class members. 

As per the typescript, constructor will be created with "constructor" keyword.

class <classname>
{
	constructor([args])
	{
		......
	}
}

Note :- 
TypeScript  variables/objects declared outside of the typescript classes can access golablly. i.e. these objects / variables can use from one program to another program directly. 
---------------------------
Inheritance :-  this concept as same as Java. 

to inherit a parent class to child class "extends" keyword is used. 

to inherit an interface to the class "implements" keyword is used. 
-----------------------------
Polymarphisum can not be implemented in TypeScript. 
--------------------------------------
Module Creation :- 
------------------
A module is a typescript class file(s) where it allows to export from  one program to another program

Here to export a class into another class, while defining a class use "export" keyword. 

export class <classname>
{
.....
}

whereever need to used exported class, there we have to import that class as follows

import {Classname } from './filename';
---------------------------------------------
Enumerations :- 
It is a collection of constants grouping under one unit. 
It is also called as "User Defined Data type" for constants. 

enum  <enum_name>
{
	const1, const2, .....
}

Once it is created, for every constant it will allocate an index number starts from 0, ....
to access value from enumeratsions, we can use these indexes.
----------------------------------------------
What is an Angular? 

It is an Client_Side framework used to create web applications. 
It allows to SPA(Single Page Application) based web applications. 
Angular works with the help of TypeScript. 
It is an  cross-platform framework. i.e. it works on any Operating System. 
It is spearate script logic and page logic with seprate files
	i.e.  Typescript Maintain one file and UI part maintain one file but both are integrated. 

How to install Angular :- 
------------------------
Install NOde JS
Install TypeScript
Install Angular using AngularCLI at command prompt
		npm install @angular/cli -g  -- for latest version

		npm install @angular/cli@10.2.0 -g  - for specific version
Use anyone editor to the code the angular application(VSCode).
------------------------------
How to create an angular application:- 

	1. goto command prompt, then use following command
			ng  new <application_name>
How to run the application:-
		use following commands at command prompt
			ng serve

to stop application : Ctrl+C
--------------------
What is a Component?
	It is a main piller of the angularapplication, which has set of files for different purposes
		one html file :-  for UI
		one css file :-  for Design
		one TS file  :-  for scripting
		one spec.ts file :-  for testing

whenever we create a new application, by default one componenet will be created with the name "APP".
it is the root component, because by using this component only other components are executed. 

To create a componenet :
		ng generate  component  <component_name>;
				or
		ng g component  <component_name>;
--------------------------
Data Bindings :- 
It is a the process of relation b/w template(html file) and script(ts file).

these data bindings used in 4 ways:- 

1. Interpolation
2. Property Binding
3. Event Binding
4. Two - Way Binding

1.  Interpolation :- it is the process of presenting script varaible value into template
				in html file:  {{variable name}}
3. Event Binding :-  Appling event for html form tags(button, radiobutton, ....)
		<tag     (eventname) = "methodname()" .... />
