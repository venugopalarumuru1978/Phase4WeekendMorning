RxJS Module
---------------------
RxJS stands for *R*eactive E*x*tensions for *J*ava*S*cript, 

itâ€™s a library that gives us an implementation of Observables for JavaScript.
RxJS, is a reactive library used to implement reactive programming to deal with async implementation, callbacks, and event-based programs.

Observable :- It is a data source(events, http request, custom data source..) which sends in the form of data packets to the observer.

Observer :-  It is an object that subscribes to the observable and listens to the data packets that sends by observable.

these two classes comes under RxJS Module.  
--------------------
What is a Subscription?  
Normally Subscription means an arrangement to receive something.   

Similarly, in Angular applications Observables will be connected to observers and whenever they observe a new value or change in data, they will execute code with the help of Subscription and all the subscribed components will receive the updated outcome. 

There is a method to this action subscribe(). 

--------------------------------------------------
HttpClient :-  This class is used to send request and get responses with the help of any API's.

getmapping  = get()
postmapping = post()
putmapping = put()
deletemapping = delete()

Steps :- 
1.  Configure json server with specific table and start that server. Keep that json file into application  folder.
2. Open Angular application, then add the components which are requiered. 
3. Design the component as per the required. 
4. Create a service in angular app, then define all the api calls in that service
5. Add "HttpClientModule" package in app.module.ts file.
6. Call that service methods whereever it is needed.
