Today's Agenda:-
---------------
JavaScript
TypeScript
----------------------
What is a JavaScript:-

Script is meant for  Programming with web page.

there are couple of script lang
	VBScript
	JavaScript
	ECMAScript  (Modified versions of ECMA Script is ES5/ES6)
	-----------
	Front End Programming Lang:-  these languages uses  javascript framework
		Angular, React JS, NodeJs, Vue JS, Express JS
		
		Angular works with TypeScript
		React Js works with ES5/ES6
From all the script languages, JavaScript is a Browser Independent Script Lang. 

JavaScript is loosely type script lang which meant for following things
		1.  Creating Dynamic Web Pages
		2.  Validating Web Page Inputs
JavaScript is an Object based script lang. 

1.  Since it is a Loosely typed Script lang, it won't provide any data types to declare variables. 
		Variable = Value;
			or
		var/let Variable = value;
	here Based value stored in variable, data type will be assigned. 
	
		var x = 100; // integer
		var y = 12.45; // float
		var str = "JavaScript" // string
		
	Note :-  as per strings, it can enclose either within " " / with in ' '

2.  Any Script will be defined in HTML page only with following tag. 
	<script  type="text/javascript">
		script code
	</script>
	the above script tag can be placed either in <head>  /  in at the bottom of <body> tag.

3.  To print something on the browser, use following statement
	document.write/writeln("stmt"/variable);
		here "document" is an pre-defined object which represents currently working web page.

4.   To print something on the brower console, use following statement
		console.log("stmt"/variable);
			here "console" is an object which represents command prompt of the browser.
5. As per script, every task will be finished by creating a user defined function, so that we have to know how to create user defined function. 

	function  <fun_name>([arg])
	{
		body of the script;
	}

Once udf defined, it has to be called as follows:-
	fun_name([arg values]);

6.  Any GUI Programming having Event Driven Programming to handle actions for tools like button, 	textbox, radiobutton, ......
Event :-  It is an action oriented method executed based on the other actions.
		Click			-  for button  "onclick"  property
		Double Click		-   for button "ondoubleclick" property
		Change			-  for radiobutton, dropdownlist "onchange" property
		KeyPress
		KeyDown
		DragAndDrop
		Load			-  for page load(<body>) this event is used. event name is 						"onload".
		Submit			-  for submit button there is an event "onsubmit". it has to 						be used in <form> tag.
7. JavaScript allows to identify any element/tag with "id" property by using following method.
		document.getElementById("id propname")
this method having two properties  to assgin values
	innerText :-  it takes any value in the form of text format.
	innerHTML :-  it takes any value in the form of html format.
8. <form> tag:-  This is used to hold set of input tags within it. 
		<form  name="name of form"  method="POST/GET"  action="PageName">

		</form>
	Note:-  To get/set value for any tool like textbox, radionbutton, ...
				"formname.toolname.value"
9.  To convert  values from string to numeric types
		parseInt(str) :-  convert value from string to integer
		parseFloat(str) :-  convert value from string to decimal

10.  To declare an array in javascript
	var <variable> = [val1, val2, ....];
---------------------------
As Per OOPS :- 
Object, Class, Data Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymarphisum

The programming languages are classified into two types

1. Object Oriented  :- where the language allows to implement all concepts of OOPS.
				Ex:-  C++, Java, C#.Net, .... 
2. Object Based	    :-  Where the language allows to implement partial concepts of oops. 
				Ex:-  VB6.0, JavaScript, ....
