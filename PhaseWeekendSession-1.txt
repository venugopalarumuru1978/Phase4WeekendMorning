CSS :-  Cascading Style Sheets

It is meant for appling styles for the web page to provide look and feel. 


CSS can be used into 3 ways

1.  Inline CSS  :-   these are used for every tag with "Style" Prop.
			<tagname style="propname:value;propname:value;...." />
2.  Page Level CSS :- these css are defined in <head> tag of the web page as follows
			
		<head>
			<style>
				
			</style>
		</head>

	For Every tag it allows to write css as follows
		tagname {
			propname:value;
			......
		}

	CSS allows to write user defined css classes for styles, these are defined in two ways
			by using .(dot)

				.cssclassname{
					propname:value;
					.....
				}

			to implement these classes use "class" prop for every tag
				<tagname   class="cssclassname" .... />

			by using #(Hash)
				#cssclassname{
					propname:value;
					...........
				}
			to implement these classes use "id" prop for every tag
				<tagname  id="cssclassname" .... />
3.  Site Level CSS :- 
	these css are used in multiple web pages

		a.  Create a file with an extension .css
		b.  define css in that file
		c.  Link that css file to every web page in head tag by following tag
			<link  href="css filename"  rel="stylesheet" />
