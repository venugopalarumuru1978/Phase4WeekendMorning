Today's Agenda:- 
---------------
1. Forms and Validations
2. Services
3. JSON  Server
----------------
Forms & Validations:- 
As per angular, there are two types of forms 

1. Template Driven Forms
2. Reactive Driven Forms

Template Driven Forms :- 
these  forms normal forms regularly creating using html, for that form by using anuglar we can apply validations. 

this type of forms are useful whenever creating simple forms like Login, Feedback, Contact .....

to create any type of forms first we have import "FormsModule". 

------------------------

Reactive Driven Forms :- 

These forms are newly added forms into angular. here form creation will be done in typescript file later html controls are created. 

1.  Import a Module called as "ReactiveFormsModule"
2.  To represent each field  user has to use following classes 
		FormControl, FormGroup, FormBuilder is used to hold group of controls. 
3.  To specify validations, use "Validators" class

FormGroup:-  it is a class which holds set of controls of the specific form. it is used as form name also. 
FormControl :- It is also a class which specifies a field in a form.

frmGroupObj = new FormGroup({
	fieldname: new FormControl('default value', [Validations using Validators Class]),
	fieldname: new FormControl('default value', [Validations using Validators Class]),
..................
});

Form Creation using FormBuilder :- 

private builder : FormBuilder

formName = this.builder.group({
	fieldname: this.builder.control('', Validators.validations),
	...........................
	...........................
});

----------------------------
For Validation purpose for Both Template & Reactive Driven Forms:-

touched 
	true  :  field focused
	false :  field not focused

untouched 
	true  :  field not focused
	false :  field  focused
					
pristine 
	true  :  field not modified by the user
	false :  field modified  by the user

valid 
	true :  field value is valid
	false:  field value not valid

invalid 
	true :  field value not valid
	false:  field value  valid

^[0-9]*$ = Only Numbers
^[a-zA-Z]*$ = only alphabets
------------------
ng add  @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap  :-  it will install bootstrap to the working application.
--------------------------------------------------
Services :- 
The service is a class which contains reusable code(business logic, validations, calculations) etc.
which can be called in one or more components. so that basically service exist of reusable properties and methods. 

ng g service <service name>

To create any indiviusal typescript class in angular application

ng g class <classname>
-------------------------------------------------------
JSON Server :- 

JSON Server is used to create an REST API's in local system. 
Steps :- 

1.  Install JSON Server in your local system.
	npm install -g json-server

2.  Create a db file for json server data.  filename must be "db.json" and keep data in the form json 		format.

{
"tablename":[
	{
	"fieldname":value,
	"fieldname":value, 
	.......
	}, 
	{
	"fieldname":value,
	"fieldname":value, 
	.......
	}, 
	.......
],
"tablename":[
		{
	"fieldname":value,
	"fieldname":value, 
	.......
	}, 
	{
	"fieldname":value,
	"fieldname":value, 
	.......
	}, 
......
]
}
3.  to work with that data, we have to start that server
	json-server  db.json
4.  Once server is started, then goto web browser then use following url
		http://localhost:3000

-------------------
HttpClient :- this class is used to call the REST API's (POST/GET/PUT/DELETE).

POST :- Adding new Data
GET :- Retriving Data Retriving Server
Delete :-  delete data into table 
PUT = Modify data
